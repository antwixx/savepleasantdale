							<h3>Health and Environmental Risks of Gas Stations</h3>
                            <p>Extensive research demonstrates that gas stations pose significant health and environmental risks to nearby communities. Gasoline releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs), most notably benzene—a confirmed human carcinogen.<p>
Several case‐control and registry studies, including one in Northern Italy, have found that children who live near petrol stations have a substantially higher risk of developing childhood leukemia, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Other studies similarly link residential proximity to sources of benzene (traffic, gas stations) with increases in respiratory illness, asthma flare-ups, and reduced lung function among children. 
</p>
                            
                            <p>The risks also extend to workers. A study of 150 gasoline station workers (fueling workers and cashiers) showed that over 70% face elevated lifetime cancer risk attributable to benzene exposure, and more than half show non-cancer health risk (hazard quotients above safe thresholds). Chronic exposure has also been associated with neurological issues, reproductive harm, and immune system impairment in more limited studies. <p>
							Environmental hazards present further concern. Decades of data on leaking underground storage tanks in the U.S. indicate widespread contamination of soil and groundwater, including drinking water sources, with fuel components such as benzene. These leaks degrade environmental quality and can depress property values in affected neighborhoods.
Even under modern safety regulations, benzene emissions can travel significant distances. Some studies indicate that emissions from petrol stations and traffic sources can affect air quality and health outcomes hundreds of meters from the source, meaning many existing zoning rules may not offer sufficient protection. (Implication drawn from the buffer analyses in proximity studies.) 
<p>This body of evidence shows that both living and working near gas stations are associated with increased risks of cancer, respiratory disease, and long-term environmental harm.

							<h3>Environmental Risks</h3>
                            <p>Constructing a new gas station near Lemont poses serious environmental threats to local ecosystems. Gas stations are recognized sources of pollution from multiple vectors: underground storage tank (UST) leaks, stormwater runoff carrying oil and heavy metals, and emissions of volatile organic compounds. One of the gravest risks is contamination of groundwater. Once petroleum compounds or heavy metals infiltrate aquifers, they not only jeopardize drinking water supplies but also enable pollutants to travel well beyond the site, affecting downstream communities and ecosystems. Cleanup of contaminated groundwater is expensive, often incomplete, and residual pollutants can pose long-term health risks for decades.                             
                            <p>This issue is especially acute in light of proximity to the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve, home to sensitive and protected species such as the state-threatened Blanding’s turtle and the federally endangered Hine’s emerald dragonfly. These species depend on clean, groundwater-fed wetlands and aquatic habitats. Even relatively small shifts in water quality—such as minor contamination from runoff or leaks—can disrupt breeding cycles, reduce available food sources (e.g. aquatic invertebrates), and push these already vulnerable populations further toward decline or local extinction. The Hine’s emerald dragonfly, for example, requires wetlands with shallow, slowly flowing, groundwater-fed water over calcareous bedrock, along with specific vegetation and even crayfish burrows for larvae survival. <p>
							In summary, a gas station in this location would not only pose environmental and human health risks through groundwater contamination and polluted runoff, but would also represent a direct ecological threat to one of Illinois’ most biodiverse and ecologically sensitive natural areas. Safeguarding groundwater quality and habitat integrity is essential for protecting the community and preserving species that rely on these rare wetland ecosystems.

                            <h3>Traffic Pressures on Lemont Road</h3>
                            <p>The intersection of Lemont Road and 97th Street is already a critical pinch point for commuter traffic in the area. It serves as a primary route for employees traveling to Argonne National Laboratory, one of the largest employers in DuPage County, with over 3,400 employees and 1,000 contractors on its 1,500-acre campus in Lemont. Peak morning and evening hours see long queues of vehicles at the signals, with heavy cross-traffic entering and exiting from residential streets.
<br><br>Introducing a high-volume commercial use such as a gas station would intensify these strains by:
<ul><li>Adding frequent turning movements in and out of driveways, slowing traffic flow.</li>
	<li>Introducing delivery trucks and tankers that require wider turning radii and longer dwell times at intersections.</li>
	<li>Increasing the number of conflict points where vehicles cross paths, raising the likelihood of collisions.</li>
</ul><p><br>
National traffic safety research confirms that driveways near intersections significantly increase crash rates, particularly for left turns into and out of commercial properties. Gas stations in particular are identified as “high crash generators” due to the mix of turning vehicles, large fuel deliveries, and customer traffic.
                            
                            <h3>Neighborhood Constraints & Safety Issues</h3>
                            <p>The Pleasantdale neighborhood is uniquely vulnerable to traffic disruptions because it has only three access points. Two of these—at 97th and 99th Streets—sit immediately adjacent to the proposed gas station site. This creates a direct overlap between resident traffic and gas station traffic.
<br><br>Key risks include:
<ul><li>Bottleneck effects: With so few access routes, even minor backups could trap residents or delay them from reaching Lemont Road.
<li>Safety concerns for families and school buses: Increased congestion and turning movements near access points raise the likelihood of vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Research shows that heavy traffic near residential streets contributes to lower walkability and higher crash risk for children.
<li>Emergency response delays: Fire trucks, ambulances, and police vehicles rely on clear neighborhood access. Studies demonstrate that congestion near residential entrances can significantly slow emergency response times, especially in cul-de-sac or limited-entry neighborhoods.
<p><br>In short, the combination of an already congested commuter corridor and limited neighborhood access points makes the proposed gas station a disproportionate risk for Pleasantdale residents.

							<h3>Public Safety</h3>
                            <p>Gas stations and truck stops are consistently identified as higher-risk locations for crime, with impacts on both employees and surrounding communities.<p>
According to the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), gas station workers experience some of the highest rates of workplace homicide among retail industries, with about 5.6 homicides per 100,000 employees annually in gas station environments. The FBI and industry data further show that convenience stores and gas stations account for roughly 13.8% of robberies nationwide, and about 4.5% of all violent crimes occur at these locations.

                            <h3>Risks to Private Wells</h3>
                            <p>Private wells are especially vulnerable because they draw directly from groundwater and often lack the oversight, treatment, and regular testing required of municipal water supplies. <br><br>Nearby gas station operations can threaten wells in several ways:
<ul><li>Leaks from underground fuel storage tanks (USTs), spills at fuel pumps, or runoff carrying petroleum byproducts can enter the soil and migrate into aquifers. Gasoline components like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) are highly mobile in soil and water; even small leaks may contaminate large volumes of groundwater. 
<li>Benzene in particular is of concern: it is known to be carcinogenic, and low-level contamination in drinking water has serious long-term health implications.
<li>Because private wells are not regulated in the same way as public systems, many homeowners do not routinely test their well water. Contamination may go undetected until levels are high. Once aquifers are polluted, remediation is expensive, technically challenging, and sometimes only partially effective.
</ul>
                            
                            <h3>Risks to Septic Systems</h3>
                            <p>Septic systems depend on a delicate balance: clean soil, proper drainage, and functioning groundwater flow are essential. <br><br>Gas station development can disrupt these compounding risks:
<ul><li>Impervious surfaces (like pavement) from a new development increase runoff and reduce natural recharge of groundwater. This changes how water percolates through soil, potentially overloading septic drain fields, interfering with soil filtration, and worsening how wastewater is naturally treated. 
<li>If groundwater in the area becomes contaminated with petroleum product chemicals, those contaminants can interact with septic effluent. Soil microbes (which help “treat” wastewater by breaking down pathogens and organic matter) may be harmed, reducing the system’s ability to mitigate pollution. Contaminants might also move more easily from the septic system into the surrounding groundwater if the soil’s capacity to adsorb or filter them is compromised. 
<li>Because septic effluent and private well water often share the same shallow groundwater system in many residential areas, contamination from gasoline leaks or spills plus septic discharge creates a combined risk: drinking water may carry both petroleum contaminants and pathogens or excess nutrients. This overlap increases the chance of health effects for entire neighborhoods rather than just individual wells.
